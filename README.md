# Markdown online
In this project, I wanted to work more on the design. Markdown online is a web editor of markdown syntax. The project is hosted [here](https://markdown.pkozak.org/?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=project).

The project was built with React and TypeScript.

## What is markdown?
Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 and has been adopted by a number of other projects. It is a subset of the HTML and XML formats. It is easy to learn and to use.
What is the purpose of this project?

I allways struggled to with writing github readmes and remembering the syntax. So I thought, that by writing a markdown editor I would be able to write better readmes and memorize the syntax.
